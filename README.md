# OTC Events DB 

With the original events DB gone, it was time to bring it back.  Except this time it's completely open source so that
it can be resurrected if I ever stop maintaining it.

## IRC Bot

The code for the IRC bot is primarily contained in the BaneBot folder.  The bot is a Twisted based Python IRC bot.  It
uses the BaneBot framework, which will be found at sometime in the future in my GitHub.

## Web Site

The code the site uses the excellent [Flask micro-framework](http://flask.pocoo.org/) along with MongoDB.
